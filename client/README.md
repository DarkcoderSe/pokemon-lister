# Pokemon Project Frontend

This is the frontend application for the Pokemon Project, which allows users to view and interact with a table of Pokemon data retrieved from the backend Flask API. The frontend is built using React with TypeScript and Material-UI for the UI components.

## Requirements

- Node.js (v14 or above)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## How to Install?

1. Clone the repository from the GitHub repository.

2. Navigate to the "frontend" directory within the cloned repository: `cd frontend`

3. Install the required dependencies using npm: `npm install`


## How to Run?

After installing the dependencies, you can run the frontend application using the following command: `npm start`


This will start the development server, and the application will be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser.

## Features

The frontend application provides the following features:

- Display a table of Pokemons with their data and images.
- Pagination: Users can navigate through multiple pages of Pokemon data.
- Search: Users can search for specific Pokemons by name.
- Filter: Users can filter Pokemons based on their base experience, height, and weight.


## Additional Information

- The frontend application communicates with the backend Flask API to fetch the Pokemon data. Make sure the backend server is running and accessible at `http://localhost:5000` or update the API URL accordingly in `PokemonTable.tsx`.
- The application is built with responsiveness in mind and should work well on various screen sizes.
